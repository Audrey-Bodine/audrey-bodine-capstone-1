    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>
        I enjoy reading, particularly fiction but I will also pick up non-fiction. The most well-loved playlists in my library
        are an eclectic mix of 70s classic rock, easy listening artists like Diana Krall and Julie London, and the charismatic lazy Sunday melodies of Dean Martin.
        Television in sitcom format is a common pastime for me, whereas my movie tastes differ like my music selections; anything from romantic comedy to sci-fi quests to high-stakes spy adventure.
